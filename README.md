# Matlab to MINEOS

This repository contains:
1) a Matlab wrapper written by Zach Eilon that drives the Fortran-based normal mode summation codes, MINEOS. 
2) Everything required to compile the Fortran executables and libraries contained in the submodule [MINEOS](https://github.com/jbrussell/MINEOS/tree/0a0d86034ca0104ca055f15a425dde82ea73b5da). These codes were provided by Colleen Dalton, and the bash wrapper for compiling was written by Emily Hopper. It is included in this repo as a submodule.
